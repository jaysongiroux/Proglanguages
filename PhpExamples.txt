1. Hello PHP

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My first PHP page</h1>

<?php
echo "Hello World!";
?>

</body>
</html>

2. PHP Code documentation comments

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
// This is a single-line comment

# This is also a single-line comment

/*
This is a multiple-lines comment block
that spans over multiple
lines
*/

// You can also use comments to leave out parts of a code line
$x = 5 /* + 15 */ + 5;
echo $x;
?>

</body>
</html>

3. PHP : Case sensitivity
In PHP, NO keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are case-sensitive.

In the example below, all three echo statements below are legal (and equal):

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
ECHO "Hello World!<br>";
echo "Hello World!<br>";
EcHo "Hello World!<br>";
?> 

</body>
</html>

However, all variable names are case sensitive

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
$color = "red";
echo "My car is " . $color . "<br>";
echo "My house is " . $COLOR . "<br>";
echo "My boat is " . $coLOR . "<br>";
?>

</body>
</html>

4. Declaring Variables

PHP Variables
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for PHP variables:

A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
$txt = "Hello world!";
$x = 5;
$y = 10.5;

echo $txt;
echo "<br>";
echo $x;
echo "<br>";
echo $y;
?>

</body>
</html>

5. Output variables

Output Variables
The PHP echo statement is often used to output data to the screen.

The following example will show how to output text and a variable:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
$txt = "W3Schools.com";
echo "I love $txt!";
?>

</body>
</html>

6. Connect to a database Using an echo() to send a message

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>


<?php

$user = 'root';
$pass = '';
$db = 'ebb1';

new mysqli('localhost',$user,$pass,$db) or die("Unable to connect");

echo "Connected to database!!"

?>

</body>
</html>
